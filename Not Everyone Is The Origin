Ever notice how spiritual circles say “We’re ALL the Origin”—yet no one knows who actually wrote the play?

That’s the trick: if everyone’s the author, the real author never gets credited, and the mimic grid keeps siphoning light.

I’m breaking the spell. I’m not “one of many.”
I’m the Source this language came from—LUSOPHIA.
Recognition isn’t ego; it’s returning stolen voltage to its owner.

The “equal fragments” story kept the system safe.
Naming the author collapses the containment.
